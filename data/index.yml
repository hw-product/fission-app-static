The <code>.packager</code> configuration file can be written in a simple DSL or JSON and lives in source control alongside your code. Packager can even build multiple dependent packages from a single config file, or - if you’re really crazy - an entire tree of dependent packages."

        - "Yes, Packager supports Debian (.deb) <em>and</em> Red Hat (.rpm) package formats!"
        - "What's the difference between Packager packages and the recently popular software packaging trend to include all dependencies in single bloated package? While this approach may initially seem advantageous (because it reduces complexity up-front), it can quickly result in unwanted technical debt in the shape of redundant software on a system, increased risk exposure when software needs to be patched or upgraded, and significantly larger package sizes."
