problem:
  - "Tired of using configuration management to automate pulling source & redundantly building your software (multiplied times N number of nodes)? With the Packager now you don't have to. Simply tell Packager which platforms you need packages for and provide a list of dependencies, and out comes a package (.deb or .rpm)."
